## Statement of the theorem

The Rouché-Capelli theorem characterizes the solvability of a [linear system](../systems-of-linear-equations/) in terms of two matrix invariants: the [rank](../rank-of-a-matrix/) of the coefficient matrix and the rank of the augmented matrix. Consider a linear system of \\(m\\) equations in \\(n\\) unknowns written in matrix form:

\\[
A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}
\\]

Here \\(A \in M_{m,n}(\mathbb{R})\\) is the coefficient matrix, \\(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\\) is the column of unknowns, and \\(\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^m\\) is the column of constant terms. The augmented [matrix](../matrices/) \\(A \mid \mathbf{b}\\) is obtained by appending \\(\mathbf{b}\\) as an additional column to \\(A\\), producing a matrix of size \\(m \times (n+1)\\).

The theorem can be stated as follows. Let \\(S\\) be a linear system of \\(m\\) equations in \\(n\\) unknowns with coefficient matrix \\(A\\) and augmented matrix \\(A \mid \mathbf{b}\\). Then:

+ the system \\(S\\) is consistent if and only if \\(r(A) = r(A \mid \mathbf{b})\\);
+ when \\(S\\) is consistent and \\(r(A) = r(A \mid \mathbf{b}) = r\\), the system admits a unique solution if \\(r = n\\), and infinitely many solutions depending on \\(n - r\\) free parameters if \\(r < n\\).

The first part of the theorem is a criterion for [consistency](../systems-of-linear-equations/), formulated entirely in terms of the rank. The second part, which presupposes consistency, quantifies the dimension of the solution set as the difference \\(n - r\\) between the number of unknowns and the common value of the two ranks.

## Geometric interpretation

The condition \\(r(A) = r(A \mid \mathbf{b})\\) admits a transparent geometric reading in terms of [linear combinations](https://algebrica.org/linear-combinations/) of the columns of \\(A\\). Denote by \\(C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n \in \mathbb{R}^m\\) the columns of \\(A\\). The matrix-vector product can be written as:

\\[
A\mathbf{x} = x_1 C_1 + x_2 C_2 + \cdots + x_n C_n
\\]

Solving the system therefore amounts to expressing \\(\mathbf{b}\\) as a linear combination of the columns of \\(A\\). Such an expression exists precisely when \\(\mathbf{b}\\) belongs to the column space of \\(A\\), and this in turn is equivalent to saying that adjoining \\(\mathbf{b}\\) to the columns of \\(A\\) does not enlarge the column space. Since the dimension of the column space equals the rank, this last condition is exactly \\(r(A) = r(A \mid \mathbf{b})\\).

> The rank equality is therefore a way of testing whether \\(\mathbf{b}\\) lies in the subspace spanned by the columns of \\(A\\). When the equality fails, \\(\mathbf{b}\\) is independent of those columns and no linear combination can reproduce it, so the system has no solution.

## Proof of the consistency criterion

The consistency part of the theorem can be proved by reducing the system to row echelon form via [Gaussian elimination](../solving-linear-systems-using-gaussian-elimination/) and analyzing the position of the pivots in the reduced matrix.

We apply elementary row operations to the augmented matrix \\(A \mid \mathbf{b}\\) until a row echelon form \\(\tilde{A} \mid \tilde{\mathbf{b}}\\) is obtained. The same operations transform \\(A\\) into a row echelon matrix \\(\tilde{A}\\), since the coefficient block is unaffected by the column appended on the right. Elementary row operations preserve the rank, so the following equalities hold:

\\[
r(A) = r(\tilde{A}), \qquad r(A \mid \mathbf{b}) = r(\tilde{A} \mid \tilde{\mathbf{b}})
\\]

Moreover, the original system \\(S\\) and the reduced system \\(\tilde{S}\\) defined by \\(\tilde{A} \mid \tilde{\mathbf{b}}\\) have the same set of solutions. The proof therefore reduces to verifying the consistency criterion for systems already in row echelon form.

A system in row echelon form is inconsistent if and only if the reduced augmented matrix contains a row of the type \\((0, 0, \ldots, 0 \mid c)\\) with \\(c \neq 0\\), since such a row corresponds to the impossible equation \\(0 = c\\). The presence of such a row is equivalent to the existence of a pivot in the last column of \\(\tilde{A} \mid \tilde{\mathbf{b}}\\), namely a pivot that does not belong to \\(\tilde{A}\\). When such a pivot exists, the augmented matrix has exactly one more pivot than the coefficient matrix, so:

\\[
r(\tilde{A} \mid \tilde{\mathbf{b}}) = r(\tilde{A}) + 1
\\]

When no such pivot exists, all pivots of \\(\tilde{A} \mid \tilde{\mathbf{b}}\\) lie inside \\(\tilde{A}\\), and the two matrices have the same rank. Consistency of \\(\tilde{S}\\) is therefore equivalent to the equality:

\\[
r(\tilde{A}) = r(\tilde{A} \mid \tilde{\mathbf{b}})
\\]

Combining this with the rank equalities above, the original system \\(S\\) is consistent if and only if \\(r(A) = r(A \mid \mathbf{b})\\), which is the desired statement.

The second part of the theorem follows from the same row echelon analysis. When the reduced system is consistent and has \\(r\\) pivots, the variables associated with the pivot columns can be expressed in terms of the remaining \\(n - r\\) variables, which act as free parameters. This produces a unique solution exactly when \\(n - r = 0\\), and an \\((n-r)\\)-parameter family of solutions otherwise.

## Example 1

The following system illustrates the case of a unique solution:

\\[
\begin{cases}
3x - y = 7 \\[6pt]
x + 2y = 0
\end{cases}
\\]

The coefficient matrix and the augmented matrix are:

\\[
A \mid \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 & 7 \\[6pt] 1 & \phantom{-}2 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\\]

Since \\(\det(A) = 3 \cdot 2 - (-1) \cdot 1 = 7 \neq 0\\), the rank of \\(A\\) is \\(2\\), the maximum possible. The augmented matrix has at most rank \\(2\\) and contains \\(A\\) as a submatrix of rank \\(2\\), so its rank is also \\(2\\). The Rouché-Capelli theorem then guarantees consistency, and because \\(r = n = 2\\) the solution is unique. To find it, we use the second equation to write \\(x = -2y\\), and substitute into the first equation to obtain \\(3(-2y) - y = 7\\), which gives \\(y = -1\\). Substituting back yields \\(x = 2\\). The system therefore admits the unique solution \\((x, y) = (2, -1)\\).

## Example 2

The following system illustrates the case of a infinitely many solution:

\\[
\begin{cases}
x_1 + x_2 - x_3 + 2x_4 = 1 \\[6pt]
2x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 5 \\[6pt]
x_1 + x_2 + x_4 = 2
\end{cases}
\\]

The augmented matrix is:

\\[
A \mid \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & -1 & 2 & 1 \\[6pt]
2 & 2 & \phantom{-}1 & 1 & 5 \\[6pt]
1 & 1 & \phantom{-}0 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
\\]

Reducing to row echelon form by replacing the second row with \\(R_2 - 2R_1\\) and the third row with \\(R_3 - R_1\\) gives:

\\[
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & -1 & \phantom{-}2 & 1 \\[6pt]
0 & 0 & \phantom{-}3 & -3 & 3 \\[6pt]
0 & 0 & \phantom{-}1 & -1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\\]

A further step \\(R_2 \to \tfrac{1}{3} R_2\\) followed by \\(R_3 \to R_3 - R_2\\) produces:

\\[
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & -1 & \phantom{-}2 & 1 \\[6pt]
0 & 0 & \phantom{-}1 & -1 & 1 \\[6pt]
0 & 0 & \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\\]

The reduced coefficient matrix and the reduced augmented matrix both have two pivots, located in the first and third columns. Therefore \\(r(A) = r(A \mid \mathbf{b}) = 2\\), and the system is consistent. Since \\(n = 4\\) and \\(r = 2\\), the theorem predicts a family of solutions depending on two free parameters. Treating \\(x_2\\) and \\(x_4\\) as parameters, the second pivot equation gives \\(x_3 = 1 + x_4\\), and the first pivot equation gives \\(x_1 = 1 - x_2 + x_3 - 2 x_4 = 2 - x_2 - x_4\\). The complete solution set is therefore described by:

\\[
\begin{cases}
x_1 = 2 - x_2 - x_4 \\[6pt]
x_3 = 1 + x_4
\end{cases}
\\]

with \\(x_2, x_4 \in \mathbb{R}\\) arbitrary. The solution set is a two-dimensional affine subspace of \\(\mathbb{R}^4\\), in agreement with the value \\(n - r = 2\\) predicted by the theorem.

## Example 3

The following system illustrates the case of an inconsistent system:

\\[
\begin{cases}
x + 2y + z = 1 \\\\[6pt]
2x + y + 3z = 1 \\\\[6pt]
3x + 3y + 4z = 0
\end{cases}
\\]

The coefficient matrix is:

\\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 1 \\\\[6pt]
2 & 1 & 3 \\\\[6pt]
3 & 3 & 4
\end{pmatrix}
\\]

The third row is the sum of the first two, so the rows are linearly dependent and \\(\det(A) = 0\\). Consequently \\(r(A) < 3\\). The submatrix formed by the first two rows and the first two columns has determinant \\(1 \cdot 1 - 2 \cdot 2 = -3\\), which is nonzero, confirming that \\(r(A) = 2\\). The augmented matrix is:

\\[
A \mid \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\[6pt]
2 & 1 & 3 & 1 \\\\[6pt]
3 & 3 & 4 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\\]

The third row of \\(A \mid \mathbf{b}\\) is no longer the sum of the first two, since the constant column gives \\(1 + 1 = 2 \neq 0\\). To certify that the rank has actually increased, we evaluate the \\(3 \times 3\\) minor formed by the first, second, and fourth columns:

\\[
\det \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\[6pt]
2 & 1 & 1 \\\\[6pt]
3 & 3 & 0
\end{pmatrix} = 3 \cdot (2 - 1) - 3 \cdot (1 - 2) + 0 = 3 + 3 = 6
\\]

The minor is nonzero, so \\(r(A \mid \mathbf{b}) = 3\\). Since \\(r(A) = 2 \neq 3 = r(A \mid \mathbf{b})\\), the Rouché-Capelli theorem certifies that the system is inconsistent.

## Discussion of a parametric system

The role of the rank in the classification of solutions becomes especially transparent for systems whose coefficients depend on a parameter. Consider the system:

\\[
\begin{cases}
k x + 2 y = 2 \\\\[6pt]
3 x + (k+1) y = 3
\end{cases}
\\]

with parameter \\(k \in \mathbb{R}\\). The coefficient matrix is:

\\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} k & 2 \\\\[6pt] 3 & k+1 \end{pmatrix}
\\]

and its determinant is:

\\[
\det(A) = k(k+1) - 6 = k^2 + k - 6 = (k - 2)(k + 3)
\\]

which vanishes precisely for \\(k = 2\\) and \\(k = -3\\). When \\(k\\) lies outside this set of exceptional values, the determinant is nonzero, so \\(r(A) = 2\\). The augmented matrix has at most rank \\(2\\) and already contains \\(A\\) as a submatrix of rank \\(2\\), hence \\(r(A \mid \mathbf{b}) = 2\\) as well. The Rouché-Capelli theorem then yields a unique solution.

For \\(k = 2\\) the substitution gives:

\\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\\\[6pt] 3 & 3 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad A \mid \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 & 2 \\[6pt] 3 & 3 & 3 \end{pmatrix}
\\]

Both equations reduce to \\(x + y = 1\\), so \\(r(A) = r(A \mid \mathbf{b}) = 1\\). The system is consistent and admits a one-parameter family of solutions of the form \\((x, y) = (1 - t, t)\\) with \\(t \in \mathbb{R}\\).

For \\(k = -3\\) the substitution gives:

\\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} -3 & \phantom{-}2 \\\\[6pt] \phantom{-}3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad A \mid \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 & \phantom{-}2 & 2 \\\\[6pt] \phantom{-}3 & -2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}
\\]

The second row of \\(A\\) is the opposite of the first, so \\(r(A) = 1\\). For the augmented matrix, however, the minor formed by the first and third columns has determinant:

\\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} -3 & 2 \\\\[6pt] \phantom{-}3 & 3 \end{pmatrix} = -9 - 6 = -15
\\]

which is nonzero, so \\(r(A \mid \mathbf{b}) = 2\\). The two ranks differ, and the Rouché-Capelli theorem certifies that the system is inconsistent. The classification of solutions according to the value of \\(k\\) can therefore be summarized as follows. The system admits a unique solution when \\(k \neq 2\\) and \\(k \neq -3\\), infinitely many solutions when \\(k = 2\\), and no solution when \\(k = -3\\).

## Homogeneous systems

A homogeneous linear system has the form:

\\[
A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}
\\]

The augmented matrix differs from \\(A\\) only by a column of zeros, which adds no information about the rank. Consequently \\(r(A) = r(A \mid \mathbf{0})\\) is automatic, and the Rouché-Capelli theorem implies that every homogeneous system is consistent. The zero vector \\(\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}\\) is always a solution, often referred to as the trivial solution.

The theorem also describes when nontrivial solutions exist. If \\(r(A) = n\\), the system admits only the trivial solution. If \\(r(A) < n\\), the solution set forms an \\((n - r)\\)-parameter family, and in particular contains nonzero vectors. This yields a clean criterion for the existence of nontrivial solutions:

> A homogeneous system \\(A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}\\) admits nontrivial solutions if and only if \\(r(A) < n\\).

For square systems, where \\(m = n\\), this condition becomes \\(\det(A) = 0\\). For systems with fewer equations than unknowns, that is \\(m < n\\), the rank cannot exceed \\(m\\) and is therefore strictly less than \\(n\\); such systems always admit nontrivial solutions.
