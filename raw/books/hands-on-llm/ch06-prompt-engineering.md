CHAPTER 6
Prompt Engineering

In  the  first  chapters  of  this  book,  we  took  our  first  steps  into  the  world  of  large
language models (LLMs). We delved into various applications, such as supervised and
unsupervised  classification,  employing  models  that  focus  on  representing  text,  like
BERT and its derivatives.

As we progressed, we used models trained primarily for text generation, models that
are often referred to as generative pre-trained transformers (GPT). These models have
the remarkable ability to generate text in response to prompts from the user. Through
prompt engineering, we can design these prompts in a way that enhances the quality of
the generated text.

In this chapter, we will explore these generative models in more detail and dive into
the realm of prompt engineering, reasoning with generative models, verification, and
even evaluating their output.

Using Text Generation Models
Before we start with the fundamentals of prompt engineering, it is essential to explore
the  basics  of  utilizing  a  text  generation  model.  How  do  we  select  the  model  to  use?
Do  we  use  a  proprietary  or  open  source  model?  How  can  we  control  the  generated
output? These questions will serve as our stepping stones into using text generation
models.

Choosing a Text Generation Model
Choosing a text generation model starts with choosing between proprietary models
or open source models. Although proprietary models are generally more performant,
we focus in this book more on open source models as they offer more flexibility and
are free to use.

Figure 6-1 shows a small selection of impactful foundation models, LLMs that have
been  pretrained  on  vast  amounts  of  text  data  and  are  often  fine-tuned  for  specific
applications.

Figure 6-1. Foundation models are often released in several different sizes.

From  those  foundation  models,  hundreds  if  not  thousands  of  models  have  been
fine-tuned, one more suitable for certain tasks than another. Choosing the model to
use can be a daunting task!

We advise starting with a small foundation model. So let’s continue using Phi-3-mini,
which  has  3.8  billion  parameters.  This  makes  it  suitable  for  running  with  devices
up  to  8  GB  of  VRAM.  Overall,  scaling  up  to  larger  models  tends  to  be  a  nicer
experience than scaling down. Smaller models provide a great introduction and lay a
solid foundation for progressing to larger models.

Loading a Text Generation Model
The  most  straightforward  method  of  loading  a  model,  as  we  have  done  in  previous
chapters, is by leveraging the transformers library:

import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline

# Load model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct",
    device_map="cuda",
    torch_dtype="auto",
    trust_remote_code=True,
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct")

# Create a pipeline
pipe = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,

168

|

Chapter 6: Prompt Engineering

    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    return_full_text=False,
    max_new_tokens=500,
    do_sample=False,
)

Compared to previous chapters, we will take a closer look at developing and using the
prompt template.

To  illustrate,  let’s  revisit  the  example  from  Chapter  1  where  we  asked  the  LLM  to
make a joke about chickens:

# Prompt
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Create a funny joke about chickens."}
]

# Generate the output
output = pipe(messages)
print(output[0]["generated_text"])

Why don't chickens like to go to the gym? Because they can't crack the egg-
sistence of it!

Under the hood, transformers.pipeline first converts our messages into a specific
prompt template. We can explore this process by accessing the underlying tokenizer:

# Apply prompt template
prompt = pipe.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False)
print(prompt)

<s><|user|>
Create a funny joke about chickens.<|end|>
<|assistant|>

You may recognize the special tokens <|user|> and <|assistant|> from Chapter 2.
This prompt template, further illustrated in Figure 6-2, was used during the training
of the model. Not only does it provide information about who said what, but it is also
used to indicate when the model should stop generating text (see the <|end|> token).
This prompt is passed directly to the LLM and processed all at once.

In  the  next  chapter,  we  will  customize  parts  of  this  template  ourselves.  Throughout
this chapter, we can use transformers.pipeline to handle chat template processing
for us. Next, let us explore how we can control the output of the model.

Figure 6-2. The template Phi-3 expects when interacting with the model.

Controlling Model Output
Other  than  prompt  engineering,  we  can  control  the  kind  of  output  we  want  by
adjusting  the  model  parameters.  In  our  previous  example,  you  might  have  noticed
that  we  used  several  parameters  in  the  pipe  function,  including  temperature  and
top_p.

These parameters control the randomness of the output. A part of what makes LLMs
exciting  technology  is  that  it  can  generate  different  responses  for  the  exact  same
prompt. Each time an LLM needs to generate a token, it assigns a likelihood number
to each possible token.

As illustrated in Figure 6-3, in the sentence “I am driving a…” the likelihood of that
sentence  being  followed  by  tokens  like  “car”  or  “truck”  is  generally  higher  than  a
token like “elephant.” However, there is still a possibility of “elephant” being generated
but it is much lower.

Figure 6-3. The model chooses the next token to generate based on their likelihood scores.

When we loaded our model, we purposefully set do_sample=False to make sure the
output  is  somewhat  consistent.  This  means  that  no  sampling  will  be  done  and  only

170

|

Chapter 6: Prompt Engineering

the most probable next token is selected. However, to use the temperature and top_p
parameters, we will set do_sample=True in order to make use of them.

Temperature

The  temperature  controls  the  randomness  or  creativity  of  the  text  generated.  It
defines how likely it is to choose tokens that are less probable. The underlying idea
is that a temperature of 0 generates the same response every time because it always
chooses the most likely word. As illustrated in Figure 6-4, a higher value allows less
probable words to be generated.

Figure 6-4. A higher temperature increases the likelihood that less probable tokens are
generated and vice versa.

As a result, a higher temperature (e.g., 0.8) generally results in a more diverse output
while a lower temperature (e.g., 0.2) creates a more deterministic output.

You can use temperature in your pipeline as follows:

# Using a high temperature
output = pipe(messages, do_sample=True, temperature=1)
print(output[0]["generated_text"])

Why don't chickens like to go on a rollercoaster? Because they're afraid they
might suddenly become chicken-soup!

Note  that  every  time  you  rerun  this  piece  of  code,  the  output  will  change!  tempera
ture introduces stochastic behavior since the model now randomly selects tokens.

top_p

top_p, also known as nucleus sampling, is a sampling technique that controls which
subset of tokens (the nucleus) the LLM can consider. It will consider tokens until it
reaches  their  cumulative  probability.  If  we  set  top_p  to  0.1,  it  will  consider  tokens
until it reaches that value. If we set top_p to 1, it will consider all tokens.

Using Text Generation Models

|

171

As  shown  in  Figure  6-5,  by  lowering  the  value,  it  will  consider  fewer  tokens  and
generally  give  less  “creative”  output,  while  increasing  the  value  allows  the  LLM  to
choose from more tokens.

Figure 6-5. A higher top_p increases the number of tokens that can be selected to
generate and vice versa.

Similarly,  the  top_k  parameter  controls  exactly  how  many  tokens  the  LLM  can
consider. If you change its value to 100, the LLM will only consider the top 100 most
probable tokens.

You can use top_p in your pipeline as follows:

# Using a high top_p
output = pipe(messages, do_sample=True, top_p=1)
print(output[0]["generated_text"])

Why don't chickens make good comedians? Because their 'jokes' always 'feather'
the truth!

As  shown  in  Table  6-1,  these  parameters  allow  the  user  to  have  a  sliding  scale
between being creative (high  temperature and  top_p) and being predictable (lower
temperature and top_p).

Chapter 6: Prompt Engineering

Intro to Prompt Engineering
An  essential  part  of  working  with  text-generative  LLMs  is  prompt  engineering.  By
carefully designing our prompts we can guide the LLM to generate desired responses.
Whether  the  prompts  are  questions,  statements,  or  instructions,  the  main  goal  of
prompt engineering is to elicit a useful response from the model.

Prompt  engineering  is  more  than  designing  effective  prompts.  It  can  be  used  as  a
tool  to  evaluate  the  output  of  a  model  as  well  as  to  design  safeguards  and  safety
mitigation methods. This is an iterative process of prompt optimization and requires
experimentation. There is not and unlikely will ever be a perfect prompt design.

In  this  section,  we  will  go  through  common  methods  for  prompt  engineering,  and
small  tips  and  tricks  to  understand  what  the  effect  is  of  certain  prompts.  These
skills  allow  us  to  understand  the  capabilities  of  LLMs  and  lie  at  the  foundation  of
interfacing with these kinds of models.

We begin by answering the question: what should be in a prompt?

The Basic Ingredients of a Prompt
An  LLM  is  a  prediction  machine.  Based  on  a  certain  input,  the  prompt,  it  tries  to
predict  the  words  that  might  follow  it.  At  its  core  (illustrated  in  Figure  6-6),  the
prompt does not need to be more than a few words to elicit a response from the LLM.

Figure 6-6. A basic example of a prompt. No instruction is given so the LLM will simply
try to complete the sentence.

However,  although  the  illustration  works  as  a  basic  example,  it  fails  to  complete  a
specific task. Instead, we generally approach prompt engineering by asking a specific
question or task the LLM should complete. To elicit the desired response, we need a
more structured prompt.

For example, and as shown in Figure 6-7, we could ask the LLM to classify a sentence
into either having positive or negative sentiment. This extends the most basic prompt

to one consisting of two components—the instruction itself and the data that relates
to the instruction.

Figure 6-7. Two components of a basic instruction prompt: the instruction itself and the
data it refers to.

More complex use cases might require more components in a prompt. For instance,
to make sure the model only outputs “negative” or “positive” we can introduce output
indicators  that  help  guide  the  model.  In  Figure  6-8,  we  prefix  the  sentence  with
“Text:” and add “Sentiment:” to prevent the model from generating a complete sen‐
tence.  Instead,  this  structure  indicates  that  we  expect  either  “negative”  or  “positive.”
Although the model might not have been trained on these components directly, it was
fed enough instructions to be able to generalize to this structure.

Figure 6-8. Extending the prompt with an output indicator that allows for a specific
output.

Chapter 6: Prompt Engineering

We  can  continue  adding  or  updating  the  elements  of  a  prompt  until  we  elicit  the
response we are looking for. We could add additional examples, describe the use case
in more detail, provide additional context, etc. These components are merely exam‐
ples  and  not  a  limited  set  of  possibilities.  The  creativity  that  comes  with  designing
these components is key.

Although  a  prompt  is  a  single  piece  of  text,  it  is  tremendously  helpful  to  think  of
prompts  as  pieces  of  a  larger  puzzle.  Have  I  described  the  context  of  my  question?
Does the prompt have an example of the output?

Instruction-Based Prompting
Although  prompting  comes  in  many  flavors,  from  discussing  philosophy  with  the
LLM  to  role-playing  with  your  favorite  superhero,  prompting  is  often  used  to  have
the  LLM  answer  a  specific  question  or  resolve  a  certain  task.  This  is  referred  to  as
instruction-based prompting.

Figure  6-9  illustrates  a  number  of  use  cases  in  which  instruction-based  prompting
plays an important role. We already did one of these in the previous example, namely
supervised classification.

Figure 6-9. Use cases for instruction-based prompting.

Each of these tasks requires different prompting formats and more specifically, asking
different questions of the LLM. Asking the LLM to summarize a piece of text will not
suddenly result in classification. To illustrate, examples of prompts for some of these
use cases can be found in Figure 6-10.

175

Figure 6-10. Prompt examples of common use cases. Notice how within a use case, the
structure and location of the instruction can be changed.

Although  these  tasks  require  different  instructions,  there  is  actually  a  lot  of  overlap
in  the  prompting  techniques  used  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  output.  A  non-
exhaustive list of these techniques includes:

Specificity

Accurately  describe  what  you  want  to  achieve.  Instead  of  asking  the  LLM  to
“Write a description for a product” ask it to “Write a description for a product in
less than two sentences and use a formal tone.”

176

Chapter 6: Prompt Engineering

Hallucination

LLMs  may  generate  incorrect  information  confidently,  which  is  referred  to  as
hallucination.  To  reduce  its  impact,  we  can  ask  the  LLM  to  only  generate  an
answer if it knows the answer. If it does not know the answer, it can respond with
“I don’t know.”

Order

Either  begin  or  end  your  prompt  with  the  instruction.  Especially  with  long
prompts,  information  in  the  middle  is  often  forgotten.1  LLMs  tend  to  focus  on
information either at the beginning of a prompt (primacy effect) or the end of a
prompt (recency effect).

Here, specificity is arguably the most important aspect. By restricting and specifying
what  the  model  should  generate,  there  is  a  smaller  chance  of  having  it  generate
something not related to your use case. For instance, if we were to skip the instruc‐
tion “in two to three sentences” it might generate complete paragraphs. Like human
conversations, without any specific instructions or additional context, it is difficult to
derive what the task at hand actually is.

Advanced Prompt Engineering
On  the  surface,  creating  a  good  prompt  might  seem  straightforward.  Ask  a  specific
question,  be  accurate,  add  some  examples,  and  you  are  done!  However,  prompting
can  grow  complex  quite  quickly  and  as  a  result  is  an  often-underestimated  compo‐
nent of leveraging LLMs.

Here, we will go through several advanced techniques for building up your prompts,
starting  with  the  iterative  workflow  of  building  up  complex  prompts  all  the  way  to
using LLMs sequentially to get improved results. Eventually, we will even build up to
advanced reasoning techniques.

The Potential Complexity of a Prompt
As  we  explored  in  the  intro  to  prompt  engineering,  a  prompt  generally  consists  of
multiple components. In our very first example, our prompt consisted of instruction,
data,  and  output  indicators.  As  we  mentioned  before,  no  prompt  is  limited  to  just
these three components and you can build it up to be as complex as you want.

These advanced components can quickly make a prompt quite complex. Some com‐
mon components are:

Persona

Describe what role the LLM should take on. For example, use “You are an expert
in astrophysics” if you want to ask a question about astrophysics.

Instruction

The task itself. Make sure this is as specific as possible. We do not want to leave
much room for interpretation.

Context

Additional information describing the context of the problem or task. It answers
questions like “What is the reason for the instruction?”

Format

The  format  the  LLM  should  use  to  output  the  generated  text.  Without  it,  the
LLM  will  come  up  with  a  format  itself,  which  is  troublesome  in  automated
systems.

Audience

The  target  of  the  generated  text.  This  also  describes  the  level  of  the  generated
output.  For  education  purposes,  it  is  often  helpful  to  use  ELI5  (“Explain  it  like
I’m 5”).

Tone

The tone of voice the LLM should use in the generated text. If you are writing a
formal email to your boss, you might not want to use an informal tone of voice.

Data

The main data related to the task itself.

To illustrate, let us extend the classification prompt we had earlier and use all of the
preceding components. This is demonstrated in Figure 6-11.

This  complex  prompt  demonstrates  the  modular  nature  of  prompting.  We  can  add
and remove components freely and judge their effect on the output. As illustrated in
Figure 6-12, we can slowly build up our prompt and explore the effect of each change.

The  changes  are  not  limited  to  simply  introducing  or  removing  components.  Their
order,  as  we  saw  before  with  the  recency  and  primacy  effects,  can  affect  the  quality
of  the  LLM’s  output.  In  other  words,  experimentation  is  vital  when  finding  the
best  prompt  for  your  use  case.  With  prompting,  we  essentially  have  ourselves  in  an
iterative cycle of experimentation.

Try it out yourself! Use the complex prompt to add and/or remove parts to observe
its impact on the generated output. You will quickly notice when pieces of the puzzle
are worth keeping. You can use your own data by adding it to the data variable:

179

# Prompt components
persona = "You are an expert in Large Language models. You excel at breaking
down complex papers into digestible summaries.\n"
instruction = "Summarize the key findings of the paper provided.\n"
context = "Your summary should extract the most crucial points that can help
researchers quickly understand the most vital information of the paper.\n"
data_format = "Create a bullet-point summary that outlines the method. Follow
this up with a concise paragraph that encapsulates the main results.\n"
audience = "The summary is designed for busy researchers that quickly need to
grasp the newest trends in Large Language Models.\n"
tone = "The tone should be professional and clear.\n"
text = "MY TEXT TO SUMMARIZE"
data = f"Text to summarize: {text}"

# The full prompt - remove and add pieces to view its impact on the generated
output
query = persona + instruction + context + data_format + audience + tone + data

There is all manner of components that we could add and creative
components like using emotional stimuli (e.g., “This is very impor‐
tant for my career.”2). Part of the fun in prompt engineering is that
you can be as creative as possible to figure out which combination
of prompt components contribute to your use case. There are few
constraints to developing a format that works for you.

In  a  way,  it  is  an  attempt  to  reverse  engineer  what  the  model  has
learned  and  how  it  responds  to  certain  prompts.  However,  note
that  some  prompts  work  better  for  certain  models  compared  to
others as their training data might be different or they are trained
for different purposes.

In-Context Learning: Providing Examples
In  the  previous  sections,  we  tried  to  accurately  describe  what  the  LLM  should  do.
Although accurate and specific descriptions help the LLM to understand the use case,
we can go one step further. Instead of describing the task, why do we not just show
the task?

We can provide the LLM with examples of exactly the thing that we want to achieve.
This  is  often  referred  to  as  in-context  learning,  where  we  provide  the  model  with
correct examples.3

tional stimulus.” arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.11760 (2023).

Chapter 6: Prompt Engineering

As  illustrated  in  Figure  6-13,  this  comes  in  a  number  of  forms  depending  on  how
many examples you show the LLM. Zero-shot prompting does not leverage examples,
one-shot  prompts  use  a  single  example,  and  few-shot  prompts  use  two  or  more
examples.

Figure 6-13. An example of a complex prompt with many components.

Adopting  the  original  phrase,  we  believe  that  “an  example  is  worth  a  thousand
words.” These examples provide a direct example of what and how the LLM should
achieve.

We  can  illustrate  this  method  with  a  simple  example  taken  from  the  original  paper
describing  this  method.4  The  goal  of  the  prompt  is  to  generate  a  sentence  with
a  made-up  word.  To  improve  the  quality  of  the  resulting  sentence,  we  can  show
the  generative  model  an  example  of  what  a  proper  sentence  with  a  made-up  word
would be.

To do so, we will need to differentiate between our question (user) and the answers
that  were  provided  by  the  model  (assistant).  We  additionally  showcase  how  this
interaction is processed using the template:

# Use a single example of using the made-up word in a sentence
one_shot_prompt = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "A 'Gigamuru' is a type of Japanese musical instrument. An
example of a sentence that uses the word Gigamuru is:"

4 Ibid.

181

    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I have a Gigamuru that my uncle gave me as a gift. I love
to play it at home."
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "To 'screeg' something is to swing a sword at it. An example
of a sentence that uses the word screeg is:"
    }
]
print(tokenizer.apply_chat_template(one_shot_prompt, tokenize=False))

<s><|user|>
A 'Gigamuru' is a type of Japanese musical instrument. An example of a sen-
tence that uses the word Gigamuru is:<|end|>
<|assistant|>
I have a Gigamuru that my uncle gave me as a gift. I love to play it at home.<|
end|>
<|user|>
To 'screeg' something is to swing a sword at it. An example of a sentence that
uses the word screeg is:<|end|>
<|assistant|>

The prompt illustrates the need to differentiate between the user and the assistant. If
we did not, it would seem as if we were talking to ourselves. Using these interactions,
we can generate output as follows:

# Generate the output
outputs = pipe(one_shot_prompt)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"])

During the intense duel, the knight skillfully screeged his opponent's shield,
forcing him to defend himself.

It correctly generated the answer!

As  with  all  prompt  components,  one-  or  few-shot  prompting  is  not  the  be  all  and
end  all  of  prompt  engineering.  We  can  use  it  as  one  piece  of  the  puzzle  to  further
enhance  the  descriptions  that  we  gave  it.  The  model  can  still  “choose,”  through
random sampling, to ignore the instructions.

Chain Prompting: Breaking up the Problem
In previous examples, we explored splitting up prompts into modular components to
improve the performance of LLMs. Although this works well for many use cases, this
might not be feasible for highly complex prompts or use cases.

Instead  of  breaking  the  problem  within  a  prompt,  we  can  do  so  between  prompts.
Essentially, we take the output of one prompt and use it as input for the next, thereby
creating a continuous chain of interactions that solves our problem.

Chapter 6: Prompt Engineering

To illustrate, let us say we want to use an LLM to create a product name, slogan, and
sales  pitch  for  us  based  on  a  number  of  product  features.  Although  we  can  ask  the
LLM to do this in one go, we can instead break up the problem into pieces.

As  a  result,  and  as  illustrated  in  Figure  6-14,  we  get  a  sequential  pipeline  that  first
creates  the  product  name,  uses  that  with  the  product  features  as  input  to  create  the
slogan,  and  finally,  uses  the  features,  product  name,  and  slogan  to  create  the  sales
pitch.

Figure 6-14. Using a description of a product’s features, chain prompts to create a
suitable name, slogan, and sales pitch.

This  technique  of  chaining  prompts  allows  the  LLM  to  spend  more  time  on  each
individual question instead of tackling the whole problem. Let us illustrate this with a
small example. We first create a name and slogan for a chatbot:

# Create name and slogan for a product
product_prompt = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Create a name and slogan for a chatbot that
leverages LLMs."}
]
outputs = pipe(product_prompt)
product_description = outputs[0]["generated_text"]
print(product_description)

Name: 'MindMeld Messenger'

Slogan: 'Unleashing Intelligent Conversations, One Response at a Time'

Then, we can use the generated output as input for the LLM to generate a sales pitch:

# Based on a name and slogan for a product, generate a sales pitch
sales_prompt = [
    {"role": "user", "content": f"Generate a very short sales pitch for the
following product: '{product_description}'"}
]
outputs = pipe(sales_prompt)
sales_pitch = outputs[0]["generated_text"]
print(sales_pitch)

intelligent conversations with our innovative AI-powered messaging platform.

timely. Say goodbye to generic replies and hello to meaningful interactions.
Elevate your communication game with MindMeld Messenger - where every message

Although we need two calls to the model, a major benefit is that we can give each call
different parameters. For instance, the number of tokens created was relatively small
for the name and slogan whereas the pitch can be much longer.

This can be used for a variety of use cases, including:

Response validation

Ask the LLM to double-check previously generated outputs.

Parallel prompts

Create  multiple  prompts  in  parallel  and  do  a  final  pass  to  merge  them.  For
example, ask multiple LLMs to generate multiple recipes in parallel and use the
combined result to create a shopping list.

Writing stories

Leverage the LLM to write books or stories by breaking down the problem into
components. For example, by first writing a summary, developing characters, and
building the story beats before diving into creating the dialogue.

In  the  next  chapter,  we  will  automate  this  process  and  go  beyond  chaining  LLMs.
We will chain other pieces of technology together, like memory, tool use, and more!
Before that, this idea of prompt chaining will be explored further in the following sec‐
tions, which describe more complex prompt chaining methods like self-consistency,

like prompt chaining, proved to be the first step toward enabling complex reasoning
with generative models.

Reasoning is a core component of human intelligence and is often compared to the
emergent behavior of LLMs that often resembles reasoning. We highlight “resemble”
as these models, at the time of writing, are generally considered to demonstrate this
behavior through memorization of training data and pattern matching.

The  output  that  they  showcase,  however,  can  demonstrate  complex  behavior  and
although it might not be “true” reasoning, they are still referred to as reasoning capa‐
bilities. In other words, we work together with the LLM through prompt engineering
so we can mimic reasoning processes in order to improve the output of the LLM.

To  allow  for  this  reasoning  behavior,  it  is  a  good  moment  to  step  back  and  explore
what reasoning entails in human behavior. To simplify, our methods of reasoning can
be divided into system 1 and 2 thinking processes.

System  1  thinking  represents  an  automatic,  intuitive,  and  near-instantaneous  pro‐
cess. It shares similarities with generative models that automatically generate tokens
without  any  self-reflective  behavior.  In  contrast,  system  2  thinking  is  a  conscious,
slow, and logical process, akin to brainstorming and self-reflection.5

If we could give a generative model the ability to mimic a form of self-reflection, we
would essentially be emulating the system 2 way of thinking, which tends to produce
more  thoughtful  responses  than  system  1  thinking.  In  this  section,  we  will  explore
several techniques that attempt to mimic these kinds of thought processes of human
reasoners with the aim of improving the output of the model.

Chain-of-Thought: Think Before Answering
The  first  and  major  step  toward  complex  reasoning  in  generative  models  was
through  a  method  called  chain-of-thought.  Chain-of-thought  aims  to  have  the  gen‐
erative  model  “think”  first  rather  than  answering  the  question  directly  without  any
reasoning.6

As  illustrated  in  Figure  6-15,  it  provides  examples  in  a  prompt  that  demonstrate
the  reasoning  the  model  should  do  before  generating  its  response.  These  reasoning
processes are referred to as “thoughts.” This helps tremendously for tasks that involve
a  higher  degree  of  complexity,  like  mathematical  questions.  Adding  this  reasoning
step allows the model to distribute more compute over the reasoning process. Instead

of calculating the entire solution based on a few tokens, each additional token in this
reasoning process allows the LLM to stabilize its output.

Figure 6-15. Chain-of-thought prompting uses reasoning examples to persuade the gen‐
erative model to use reasoning in its answer.

We use the example the authors used in their paper to demonstrate this phenomenon:

# Answering with chain-of-thought
cot_prompt = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans
of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he
have now?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3
tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20
to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have?"}
]

# Generate the output
outputs = pipe(cot_prompt)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"])

The cafeteria started with 23 apples. They used 20 apples, so they had 23 - 20
= 3 apples left. Then they bought 6 more apples, so they now have 3 + 6 = 9
apples. The answer is 9.

Chapter 6: Prompt Engineering

Note  how  the  model  doesn’t  generate  only  the  answer  but  provides  an  explanation
before doing so. By doing so, it can leverage the knowledge it has generated thus far
to compute the final answer.

Although chain-of-thought is a great method for enhancing the output of a genera‐
tive model, it does require one or more examples of reasoning in the prompt, which
the user might not have access to. Instead of providing examples, we can simply ask
the  generative  model  to  provide  the  reasoning  (zero-shot  chain-of-thought).  There
are many different forms that work but a common and effective method is to use the
phrase “Let’s think step-by-step,” which is illustrated in Figure 6-16.7

Figure 6-16. Chain-of-thought prompting without using examples. Instead, it uses the
phrase “Let’s think step-by-step” to prime reasoning in its answer.

Using the example we used before, we can simply append that phrase to the prompt
to enable chain-of-thought-like reasoning:

# Zero-shot chain-of-thought
zeroshot_cot_prompt = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20
to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have? Let's think
step-by-step."}
]

# Generate the output
outputs = pipe(zeroshot_cot_prompt)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"])

Processing Systems 35 (2022): 22199–22213.

Step 1: Start with the initial number of apples, which is 23.
Step 2: Subtract the number of apples used to make lunch, which is 20. So, 23
- 20 = 3 apples remaining.
Step 3: Add the number of apples bought, which is 6. So, 3 + 6 = 9 apples.

The cafeteria now has 9 apples.

Without  needing  to  provide  examples,  we  again  got  the  same  reasoning  behavior.
This  is  why  it  is  so  important  to  “show  your  work”  when  doing  calculations.  By
addressing the reasoning process the LLM can use the previously generated informa‐
tion as a guide through generating the final answer.

Although  the  prompt  “Let’s  think  step  by  step”  can  improve  the
output, you are not constrained by this exact formulation. Alterna‐
tives  exist  like  “Take  a  deep  breath  and  think  step-by-step”  and
“Let’s work through this problem step-by-step.”8

Self-Consistency: Sampling Outputs
Using the same prompt multiple times can lead to different results if we allow for a
degree of creativity through parameters like temperature and top_p. As a result, the
quality of the output might improve or degrade depending on the random selection
of tokens. In other words, luck!

To counteract this degree of randomness and improve the performance of generative
models, self-consistency was introduced. This method asks the generative model the
same prompt multiple times and takes the majority result as the final answer.9 During
this process, each answer can be affected by different temperature and top_p values
to increase the diversity of sampling.

As illustrated in Figure 6-17, this method can further be improved by adding chain-
of-thought  prompting  to  improve  its  reasoning  while  only  using  the  answer  for  the
voting procedure.

Chapter 6: Prompt Engineering

Figure 6-17. By sampling from multiple reasoning paths, we can use majority voting to
extract the most likely answer.

However, this does require a single question to be asked multiple times. As a result,
although the method can improve performance, it becomes n times slower where n is
the number of output samples.

Tree-of-Thought: Exploring Intermediate Steps
The  ideas  of  chain-of-thought  and  self-consistency  are  meant  to  enable  more  com‐
plex  reasoning.  By  sampling  from  multiple  “thoughts”  and  making  them  more
thoughtful, we aim to improve the output of generative models.

These techniques only scratch the surface of what is currently being done to mimic
complex  reasoning.  An  improvement  to  these  approaches  can  be  found  in  tree-of-
thought, which allows for an in-depth exploration of several ideas.

The  method  works  as  follows.  When  faced  with  a  problem  that  requires  multiple
reasoning  steps,  it  often  helps  to  break  it  down  into  pieces.  At  each  step,  and  as
illustrated  in  Figure  6-18,  the  generative  model  is  prompted  to  explore  different

solutions to the problem at hand. It then votes for the best solution and continues to
the next step.10

Figure 6-18. By leveraging a tree-based structure, generative models can generate inter‐
mediate thoughts to be rated. The most promising thoughts are kept and the lowest are
pruned.

This method is tremendously helpful when needing to consider multiple paths, like
when writing a story or coming up with creative ideas. A disadvantage of this method
is  that  it  requires  many  calls  to  the  generative  models,  which  slows  the  application
significantly. Fortunately, there has been a successful attempt to convert the tree-of-
thought framework into a simple prompting technique.11

Instead  of  calling  the  generative  model  multiple  times,  we  ask  the  model  to  mimic
that  behavior  by  emulating  a  conversation  between  multiple  experts.  These  experts
will  question  each  other  until  they  reach  a  consensus.  An  example  of  a  tree-of-
thought prompt is:

Chapter 6: Prompt Engineering

# Zero-shot tree-of-thought
zeroshot_tot_prompt = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Imagine three different experts are answering
this question. All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking, then share
it with the group. Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc. If any
expert realizes they're wrong at any point then they leave. The question is
'The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more,
how many apples do they have?' Make sure to discuss the results."}
]

We can use this prompt to explore how an LLM might respond to complex questions:

# Generate the output
outputs = pipe(zeroshot_tot_prompt)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"])

Expert 1: Step 1 - Start with the initial number of apples: 23 apples.

Expert 2: Step 1 - Subtract the apples used for lunch: 23 - 20 = 3 apples
remaining.

Expert 3: Step 1 - Add the newly bought apples: 3 + 6 = 9 apples.

Expert 1: Step 2 - Confirm the final count: The cafeteria has 9 apples.

Expert 2: Step 2 - Review the calculations: 23 - 20 = 3, then 3 + 6 = 9. The
calculations are correct.

Expert 3: Step 2 - Agree with the result: The cafeteria indeed has 9 apples.

All experts agree on the final count: The cafeteria has 9 apples.

We again get the correct answer but instead through a “discussion between experts.”
It  is  interesting  to  see  such  a  conservation  between  “experts”  that  demonstrates  the
creativity that comes with prompt engineering.

Output Verification
Systems  and  applications  built  with  generative  models  might  eventually  end  up  in
production. When that happens, it is important that we verify and control the output
of the model to prevent breaking the application and to create a robust generative AI
application.

Reasons for validating the output might include:

Structured output

By  default,  most  generative  models  create  free-form  text  without  adhering  to
specific structures other than those defined by natural language. Some use cases
require their output to be structured in certain formats, like JSON.

191

Valid output

Even if we allow the model to generate structured output, it still has the capability
to  freely  generate  its  content.  For  instance,  when  a  model  is  asked  to  output
either one of two choices, it should not come up with a third.

Ethics

Some  open  source  generative  models  have  no  guardrails  and  will  generate  out‐
puts  that  do  not  consider  safety  or  ethical  considerations.  For  instance,  use
cases  might  require  the  output  to  be  free  of  profanity,  personally  identifiable
information (PII), bias, cultural stereotypes, etc.

Accuracy

Many use cases require the output to adhere to certain standards or performance.
The aim is to double-check whether the generated information is factually accu‐
rate, coherent, or free from hallucination.

Controlling  the  output  of  a  generative  model,  as  we  explored  with  parameters  like
top_p  and  temperature,  is  not  an  easy  feat.  These  models  require  help  to  generate
consistent output conforming to certain guidelines.

Generally, there are three ways of controlling the output of a generative model:

Examples

Provide a number of examples of the expected output.

Grammar

Control the token selection process.

Fine-tuning

Tune a model on data that contains the expected output.

In  this  section,  we  will  go  through  the  first  two  methods.  The  third,  fine-tuning  a
model, is left for Chapter 12 where we will go in depth into fine-tuning methods.

Providing Examples
A  simple  and  straightforward  method  to  fix  the  output  is  to  provide  the  generative
model  with  examples  of  what  the  output  should  look  like.  As  we  explored  before,
few-shot  learning  is  a  helpful  technique  that  guides  the  output  of  the  generative
model. This method can be generalized to guide the structure of the output as well.

For  example,  let  us  consider  an  example  where  we  want  the  generative  model  to
create a character profile for an RPG game. We start by using no examples:

# Zero-shot learning: Providing no examples
zeroshot_prompt = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Create a character profile for an RPG game in
JSON format."}

# Generate the output
outputs = pipe(zeroshot_prompt)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"])

 ```json
{
  "characterProfile": {
    "name": "Eldrin Stormbringer",
    "class": "Warlock",
    "race": "Half-Elf",
    "age": 27,
   "gender": "Male",

      "constitution": 12,
      "intelligence": 12,
      "wisdom": 10,
      "charisma

The  preceding  truncated  output  is  not  valid  JSON  since  the  model  stopped  gener‐
ating  tokens  after  starting  the  “charisma”  attribute.  Moreover,  we  might  not  want
certain attributes. Instead, we can provide the model with a number of examples that
indicate the expected format:

# One-shot learning: Providing an example of the output structure
one_shot_template = """Create a short character profile for an RPG game. Make
sure to only use this format:

{
  "description": "A SHORT DESCRIPTION",
  "name": "THE CHARACTER'S NAME",
  "armor": "ONE PIECE OF ARMOR",
  "weapon": "ONE OR MORE WEAPONS"
}
"""
one_shot_prompt = [
    {"role": "user", "content": one_shot_template}
]

# Generate the output
outputs = pipe(one_shot_prompt)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"])

{
  "description": "A cunning rogue with a mysterious past, skilled in stealth
and deception.",
  "name": "Lysandra Shadowstep",
  "armor": "Leather Cloak of the Night",
  "weapon": "Dagger of Whispers, Throwing Knives"
}

The model perfectly followed the example we gave it, which allows for more consis‐
tent behavior. This also demonstrates the importance of leveraging few-shot learning
to improve the structure of the output and not only its content.

An  important  note  here  is  that  it  is  still  up  to  the  model  whether  it  will  adhere
to  your  suggested  format  or  not.  Some  models  are  better  than  others  at  following
instructions.

Grammar: Constrained Sampling
Few-shot learning has a big disadvantage: we cannot explicitly prevent certain output
from being generated. Although we guide the model and give it instructions, it might
still not follow it entirely.

Instead,  packages  have  been  rapidly  developed  to  constrain  and  validate  the  output
of  generative  models,  like  Guidance,  Guardrails,  and  LMQL.  In  part,  they  leverage
generative  models  to  validate  their  own  output,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  6-19.  The
generative models retrieve the output as new prompts and attempt to validate it based
on a number of predefined guardrails.

Figure 6-19. Use an LLM to check whether the output correctly follows our rules.

Similarly,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  6-20,  this  validation  process  can  also  be  used  to
control the formatting of the output by generating parts of its format ourselves as we
already know how it should be structured.

Chapter 6: Prompt Engineering

Figure 6-20. Use an LLM to generate only the pieces of information we do not know
beforehand.

This  process  can  be  taken  one  step  further  and  instead  of  validating  the  output  we
can  already  perform  validation  during  the  token  sampling  process.  When  sampling
tokens,  we  can  define  a  number  of  grammars  or  rules  that  the  LLM  should  adhere
to  when  choosing  its  next  token.  For  instance,  if  we  ask  the  model  to  either  return
“positive,” “negative,” or “neutral” when performing sentiment classification, it might
still return something else. As illustrated in Figure 6-21, by constraining the sampling
process, we can have the LLM only output what we are interested in. Note that this is
still affected by parameters such as top_p and temperature.

Figure 6-21. Constrain the token selection to only three possible tokens: “positive,”
“neutral,” and “negative.”

Let us illustrate this phenomenon with llama-cpp-python, a library similar to trans
formers  that  we  can  use  to  load  in  our  language  model.  It  is  generally  used  to
efficiently  load  and  use  compressed  models  (through  quantization;  see  Chapter  12)
but we can also use it to apply a JSON grammar.

We load the same model we used throughout this chapter but use a different format
instead,  namely  GGUF.  llama-cpp-python  expects  this  format,  which  is  generally
used for compressed (quantized) models.

Since we are loading a new model, it is advised to restart the notebook. That will clear
any previous models and empty the VRAM. You can also run the following to empty
the VRAM:

import gc
import torch
del model, tokenizer, pipe

# Flush memory
gc.collect()
torch.cuda.empty_cache()

Now that we have cleared the memory, we can load Phi-3. We set  n_gpu_layers to
-1  to  indicate  that  we  want  all  layers  of  the  model  to  be  run  from  the  GPU.  The
n_ctx refers to the context size of the model. The repo_id and filename refer to the
Hugging Face repository where the model resides:

from llama_cpp.llama import Llama

# Load Phi-3
llm = Llama.from_pretrained(
    repo_id="microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf",
    filename="*fp16.gguf",
    n_gpu_layers=-1,
    n_ctx=2048,
    verbose=False
)

To generate the output using the internal JSON grammar, we only need to specify the
response_format as a JSON object. Under the hood, it will apply a JSON grammar to
make sure the output adheres to that format.

To illustrate, let’s ask the model to create an RPG character in JSON format to be used
in a Dungeons & Dragons session:

# Generate output
output = llm.create_chat_completion(
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Create a warrior for an RPG in JSON for
mat."},
    ],
    response_format={"type": "json_object"},
    temperature=0,
)['choices'][0]['message']["content"]

To check whether the output actually is JSON, we can attempt to process it as such:

import json

# Format as json
json_output = json.dumps(json.loads(output), indent=4)
print(json_output)

Summary
In  this  chapter,  we  explored  the  basics  of  using  generative  models  through  prompt
engineering and output verification. We focused on the creativity and potential com‐
plexity that comes with prompt engineering. These components of a prompt are key
in generating and optimizing output appropriate for different use cases.

We  further  explored  advanced  prompt  engineering  techniques  such  as  in-context
learning and chain-of-thought. These methods involve guiding generative models to
reason through complex problems by providing examples or phrases that encourage
step-by-step thinking thereby mimicking human reasoning processes.

Overall,  this  chapter  demonstrated  that  prompt  engineering  is  a  crucial  aspect  of
working with LLMs, as it allows us to effectively communicate our needs and prefer‐
ences  to  the  model.  By  mastering  prompt  engineering  techniques,  we  can  unlock
some  of  the  potential  of  LLMs  and  generate  high-quality  responses  that  meet  our
requirements.

The  next  chapter  will  build  upon  these  concepts  by  exploring  more  advanced  tech‐
niques for leveraging generative models. We will go beyond prompt engineering and
explore how LLMs can use external memory and tools.
